# chess-game
I want to build a basic chess board where users will be able to play. 
Current progress: You are able to move the pieces by entering the moves.

example: 
>> Piece name: n # n=knight\\
>> Enter start: b1 # The square that the piece you want to move stands on\\
>> Enter target: c3 # The square you want to move your piece to\\

piece names:
p = pawn
n = knight
b = bishop
r = rook
q = queen
k = king
