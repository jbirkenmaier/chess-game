# chess-game
I want to build a basic chess board where users will be able to play. 
Current progress: </br>
12-08-23: You are able to move the pieces by entering the moves using the console.</br>
14-08-23: Pieces now can be captured</br>


example: 
>> Piece name: n # n=knight </br>
>> Enter start: b1 # The square that the piece you want to move stands on  </br>
>> Enter target: c3 # The square you want to move your piece to  </br>

piece names: </br>
p = pawn </br>
n = knight </br>
b = bishop </br>
r = rook </br>
q = queen </br>
k = king </br>
